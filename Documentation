Neural network Implementation for Function Approximation: y = 3x + 0.7x^2
Based on the perceptron learning concepts with the following components:
- Single hidden layer architecture
- Sigmoid activation function for non linearity
- Gradient descent learning
- Mean squared error loss function

Should we add another hidden layer?
Should we test on wider range of data points?
